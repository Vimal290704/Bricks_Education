              With experience ranging from building grassroots startups to
              running real-world learning programs in schools, we bring
              unmatched energy, relevance, and creativity to everything we do.

            <p style={{ fontWeight: "bold", fontSize: "18px" }}>
              Every student we work with doesn't just learn, they explore,
              collaborate, question, and build. Because at BRICKS, we don't just
              teach. We spark futures.
